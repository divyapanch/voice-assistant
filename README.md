# AI Voice Assistant

The **AI Voice Assistant** is an intelligent, interactive virtual assistant built using Python and **Speech Recognition** technologies.  
It can listen to voice commands, process them using NLP, and respond naturally — performing tasks like answering questions, opening websites, or greeting users with personality through 3 unique avatars.


## Overview

This project is designed to simulate real-time voice-based interaction with AI.  
It can recognize user speech, convert it to text, interpret the command, and respond through synthesized speech and visual avatars.
Built with a focus on **human–computer interaction**, the assistant showcases both technical ability and creative design.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition** – Listens to user voice input and converts it to text.  
- **Text-to-Speech Response** – Replies using a natural-sounding voice.  
- **Smart Commands** – Can search online, tell the time, open applications, or answer general questions.  
- **Three Avatars** – Visual AI avatars that interact with the user dynamically:
  1. Emotional and friendly tone.  
  2. Calm, futuristic, and informative personality.  
  3. Cheerful and conversational vibe.  
- **NLP Integration** – Uses Python NLP libraries to process and understand basic commands.  
- **Interactive UI** – Smooth, minimal interface compatible with PC, iPad, and mobile screens.


## How It Works

1. The user speaks a command through their microphone.  
2. The assistant processes the input using a speech recognition model.  
3. Based on the recognized text, it performs the relevant action or response.  
4. The chosen avatar visually reacts while the assistant responds via audio output.

- 🌍 **Multilingual Support:** Understand and respond in multiple languages.  
- 🎨 **Avatar Animations:** Make avatars blink, move, and react to user tone.  
- 🔉 **Better Voice Quality:** Integrate advanced neural TTS for natural voice output.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy on web servers for universal access.  
- 📱 **Cross-Platform Support:** Make it run smoothly on mobile and tablets.
